<h2>Intro to Agora</h2>

<p>This is a guide for anyone who is curious about playing Agora. It is not at all exhaustive, because Agora is complex and changes frequently. It will cover everything from what you should (and shouldn't) do before playing, how to join, and how some of the most common gameplay actions are done (like voting and proposing).

<h2>The Rules</h2>
<p>Don't worry about reading the full ruleset right now. Instead, focus on getting the basics down in this guide, and then skim the rules as needed. Once you have a good handle on the basics, feel free to go back and re-read the whole thing.

<h2>The Mailing Lists</h2>
<p>Agora Nomic is played via mailing lists. You sign up for each mailing list, and when someone sends a message to them, you receive a copy.<p>

<p>You probably don't want Agora to send email to your inbox, because it will be a lot. One option is to set up filters. For example, <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en">here's gmail's filter instructions</a>. You can also make an email account just for Agora, as some players do.</p>

<p>Agora has 4 mailing lists, which are explained below. You should sign up for all 4:<p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-business">Agora-Business</a></em> - You send messages here to do stuff.</li>

<li><em><a href="http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-official">Agora-Official</a></em> - Officers send Reports here. That's where you can read summaries of what's currently happening. If you're not an officer sending a report, you shouldn't be sending a message here.</li>

<li><em><a href="http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-discussion">Agora-Discussion</a></em> - Players discuss the game and respond to actions here. No actions can be taken here. Note that by default, when you reply to the other two lists, the "To:" will be here. If you want to take an action, you need to change it to Agora-Business.</li>

<li><em><a href="https://agoranomic.groups.io/g/main/join">Gio</a></em> - This is the backup list. Sometimes the other lists stop working for a while, and gameplay continues here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've subscribed to each mailing list, and confirmed your subscriptions in your email, you will start receving messages as they are sent. You will also now be able to send messages. Now it's time to register.</p>

<h2>Registering</h2>

<p>Registering is a special action in Agora, to make it as easy as possible. A registration email need only indicate that you wish to join; you should also indicate what name you'd like to use. Names are changeable in Agora whenever you want. A straight-forward registration might say something like:</p>

<pre>I register for Agora. My name is nix.</pre>

<h2>Your first actions</h2>

<p>Once you register, you can immediately start taking actions. In fact, you can take actions in the same message you register. Most actions are done "by announcement", which means you just say you're doing it, and it is done. The very first such action you will want to do is grant yourself a welcome package, which gives you starting resources. You do so with a message (to Agora-Business) like this:</p>

<pre>I grant myself a Welcome Package.</pre>

<p>Search the rules for "by announcement" to see more actions you can do this way. Some of them may have other restrictions as well, so read carefully.</p>

<p>Some other actions are done "with notice", "without objection", or "with N Agoran Consent", among other methods. These are called "tabled actions", where you first need to announce you plan to do them, and then wait (usually 4 days, but it may vary by action) before you can do them. An example is declaring apathy. To do so you first send a message like this:</p>

<pre>I intend to declare apathy without objection, specifying myself.</pre>

<p>Then, four days later, if nobody has objected (someone almost certainly will!), you can say:</p>

<pre>I declare apathy, specifying myself.</pre>

<p>If nobody objected, then the action was successful.</p>

<h2>Voting</h2>

<p>Voting is fairly straightforward. You cannot vote on proposals that were already being voted on before you joined. But when you see proposals "distributed" after you join, you may vote on them. The valid votes:</p>

<ul>
<li>FOR or AGAINST - these are pretty self-explanatory</li>

<li>PRESENT - doesn't count FOR/AGAINST, but does count for quorum (the minimum number of players that need to vote on something)</li>
  
<li>ENDORSE X - you vote the same way as X, which can be a player or an officer.</li>

<li>Conditionally - Any conditional statement that could be interpreted as a vote at the time of resolution. If it is too difficult to calculate, it will be thrown out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposals</h2>

<p>Any player can submit a proposal at any time, but I strongly recommend you start with a "proto". A proto is a draft of a proposal, submitted to Agora-Discussion with a title like "[Proto] Name Proposal Here". Other players will read your proto and provide feedback. Even the most experienced players usually submit 1 or 2 (or more) protos before finally submitting a proposal.</p>

<p>A proposal has 5 parts:

<ul>
<li>Title - anything you want to call it</li>

<li>Author - you, or whoever submitted it</li>

<li>Coauthors - an optional list of anybody you want to include, usually people that gave supportive feedback</li>

<li>Adoption Index (AI) - this effects how many votes FOR the proposal needs, and what the proposal is able to change. See "Rule Power and Precedence" below.</li>

<li>Text - the actual changes of the proposal. A single proposal can amend, enact, or remove any number of rules. It can also change other things, like granting players assets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rule Power and Precedence</h2>

<p>When you start reading the rules more thoroughly, or making proposals, you will notice something called "power". "Power" is how we "break ties" in rules. If two rules contradict, the higher power rule takes precedent. You will notice that the high power rules tend to be very important parts of the game, and low power ones tend to be less important. For a proposal to change a rule, its AI has to be as high as that rule's Power, thus changing high power rules is harder than low power rules.</p>
