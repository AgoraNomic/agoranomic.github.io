<h2>Agora-isms</h2>

Things that are typical to Agora, though not necessarily legally codified.

<h3>-or</h3>

Agora tends to name offices by taking a regular title and replacing -er with -or. For example: Rulekeepor, Webmastor, Treasuror.

<h3>Proto</h3>

A proto (or protoproposal, or protosal) is an unfinished draft of a proposed rule change, submitted for feedback. Also sometimes used more widely for any rough, unfinished idea.

<h3>Scam</h3>

A way to win the game or gain something that takes advantage of an unintended consequence of the rules. Scams are generally allowed in Agora, as long as the scammers cause minimal disruption to the game. That said, when a scam is occuring most players will try to stop it.

<h3>Spivak Pronouns</h3>

Agora uses a type of neutral pronoun called Spivak for all players. This is simply e/em/eir.

<h2>Abbreviations</h2>

<h3>A-B</h3>

Agora Business AKA agora-business@agoranomic.org AKA BUS

<h3>A-D</h3>

Agora Discussion AKA agora-discussion@agoranomic.org AKA DIS

<h3>A-O</h3>

Agora Official AKA agora-official@agoranomic.org AKA OFF

<h3>AIAN</h3>

Agora Is A Nomic, Rule 1698. This rule prevents Agora from reaching a state where the rules cannot be changed by any mechanism.

<h3>CFJ</h3>

Call for Judgment. When there's confusion about something, players initiate a CFJ on a statement. Another player will judge the statement to resolve the confusion. CFJ### refers to a specific case.

<h3>CoE</h3>

Claim of Error. Used to note that a player thinks there's something wrong on a report. The officer who made the report has to respond by denying or fixing the error.

<h3>CotC</h3>

Clerk of the Courts. Currently doesn't formally exist, but this person tracks CFJs.

<h3>FLR</h3>

Full Logical Ruleset. All of the rules and annotations that include when they were edited and how.

<h3>ISIDTID</h3>

I say I do, therefore I do. Most actions are done 'by announcement', meaning they are done just by saying you do them. Others have restrictions on how or when they can be done. Sometimes the rules are ambiguous about this, which can cause debates.

<h3>MMI</h3>

Mother, May I? This refers to the rules that give special meaning to phrases like CAN, SHALL, and SHOULD in the ruleset.

<h3>NttPF</h3>

Not to the Public Forum. Usually used when a player sends a message that looks like it's supposed to be an action, but they sent it to Agora-Discussion and so it is ineffective.

<h3>RWO</h3>

Ratify without objection, a specific mechanism to change the gamestate outlined in R2202.

<h3>SLR</h3>

Short Logical Ruleset. Just the rules, with minimal annotation.

<h3>TTttPF</h3>

This time to the Public Forum. Usually used when someone first sent a message to Agora Discussion. If they quote that message and say this in Agora Business (or Agora Official) it means they take those actions.
