Whether you're a new player or an experience Agoran, you'd likely be looking to learn about the history of the game. This page consists of a collection of all known archives. As Agora has existed across multiple platforms since 1992, there are unfortunately gaps in our records. If you're aware of something missing, please let me know via the fora or chat.
